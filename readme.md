# Pathfinder

### idea
@todo: write fascinating story why word needs our service

## details
### main algorithm
Main algorithm for finding path with heatmap is A* algorithm located in file pathfinder.py. Utils like creating mask are located in map_utils.py.

@todo: insert images
- path from mundi_filters_algorithm.ipynb and algoritm_local.ipynb
- pictures of filters ideally linked to their sources

### filters
Service uses various filters:
- amoung of many: soil, vegation, moisture
- filters are blended together to create heatmap

sources:
- filters from mundi service - exmaple in mundi_filters.ipynb, mundi_filters_algorithm.ipynb
- filters from climate copernicus copernicus copernicus_climate.ipynb, copernicus_climate2.ipynb 
- filters from creodias - search_creodias.ipynb
